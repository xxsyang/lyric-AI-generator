Love, love, look what you've done to my heart
Oh, I should've known from the start
That, you'd go and tear it apart
Oh, and now you've deserved me

You never lose, you never fail
You always live to tell the tale
You take me up, you bring me down
Without a touch, without a sound

Love, love, why do I keep searching high and low?
You take me in your arms and let me go

Oh, how long must it be
Until you, come run back to me
Can't you see I got no release from the pain
Just to see you again

You never lose, you never fail
You always live to tell the tale
You take me up, you bring me down
Without a touch, without a sound

Love, love, why do I keep searching high and low?
You take me in your arms and let me go

Love, love, let me go

When will love set me free?
When will you come back to me?

Oh, love, love, why do I keep searching high and low?
You take me in your arms and let me go

Oh, lov
