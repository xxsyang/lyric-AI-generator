I said I know
He said I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this
I watched him go
He watched me crash to the floor
On my knees, just like that
He said, "When can I come back?"

I said, that's when I wake up in the morning
That's when after sun is always storming
Laughing when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when if I see your face
I'll let you in, baby that's when

I said I know
He said I did you wrong, made mistakes
Put you through all of this
'Cause I let you go, you let me think
That I'll be fine without you
Imagine that
So baby when can I come back

I said, that's when I wake up in the morning
That's when after sun is always storming
Laughing when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when if I see your face
I'll let you in, baby that's when

And I said all this playing
Did you ever think of me
And he said

That's when I woke up in the morning
That's when after sun is always storming
Laughing when I was crying
That's when we were waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby that's when

I said I know
He said I need some time, need some space''''''''
