Need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message I left on my car
Need you now
Word I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came
My world's a little colder now
But I'm keeping warm somehow

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you
I don't need you, don't need you
Now

Need you now
Words I heard you whisper to me
We were walking down a one way street
You need me now
That's what you've been telling my friends
But I've come too far to go back there again
My heart and my number has changed
You might as well forget my name

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you don't need you
And I waited so frustrated
So who's gonna hold you
I don't need you don't need you now

And I'm not what you want
I won't wonder where you are
I won't dream a thousand stars
I don't need you now
I don't need you by the rain
And I never heard you say
I need you, I need you
I don't need you now
Don't need you
I don't need you
