Here you come again
Just when I'm about to get myself together
You waltz right through the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger

Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes, and light those dreamy eyes
And pretty soon I'm wonderin'
How I came to doubt you

All you gotta do
Is smile that smile, and there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you, and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses

Here you come again
Lookin' better than a body has the right to
And shakin' me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again

All you gotta do
Is smile that smile, and there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you, and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses

Here you come again
Lookin' better than a body has the right to
And shakin' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again
And here I go
And here you come again
And here I go, oh, oh
And here I go
And here you come again
And here I go, oh, no
And here I go'
