The way you love is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that you send me runnin'
But I kind of know that I won't get far

And you stood there in front of me just
Close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause' I see sparks fly
Whenever you Smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something little hot
For when you'r not around
Cause' I see sparks fly
Whenever you Smile

My mind forgets to advise me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and
It's really something
You find I'm even better
Than you imagined I would be

I'm on my guard with the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I
I really wish you would

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause' I see sparks fly

Whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something little hot
For when you're not around
Cause' I see sparks fly
Whenever you Smile

I run my fingers through your hair
And watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase slowly
And whisper something slow
???????
Like a firework show

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause' I see sparks fly
Whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something little hot
For when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly
Whenever you
Smile

And the sparks fly
Yeah baby smile
And the sparks fly
Y
