You should have been there
Should have burst through the door
With that "Baby, I'm right here." smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy

Christmas lights glisten

And I would've been so happy

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me singing
"Happy birthday to you."
But there's one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

Ooh, I knew.

You call me later
And say "I'm sorry I didn't make it."
And I say "I'm sorry, too."
And that was the moment I kne
