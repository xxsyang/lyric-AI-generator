T-Pain:
Hey, Hey
T-Swizzle, T-Pizzle

Taylor Swift:
I'm like 8 foot 4, blond hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore

No I ain't got a gun
No I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents
But I'm still a thug

I'm so gangsta you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing, but I just made caramel delight

T-Pain:
Good

Taylor Swift:
T-Swift and T-Pain rappin' on the same track
It's a thug story tell me can you handle that

Both:
I had a dream last night

Taylor Swift:
I had high-top Nikes
I had

Both:
Diamonds in my mouth, and diamonds on my mic

Taylor Swift:
By the time I woke up I was singing

T-Pain:
"I'm on a boat"

Taylor Swift:
'Cause I'm a singer turned rapper

T-Pain:
Shorty imma make ya

Taylor Swift:
Straight to the top, yo

T-Pain:
Shorty imma take ya

Taylor Swift:
You can call me T-Sweezy now I'm a rap star

T-Pain:
Hey, it's a thug story now tell them who you are
Singer turned gangsta

Taylor Swift:
You don't wanna fight me

T-Pain:
Straight to the top

Taylor Swift:
In my extra small white tee

T-Pain:
T-Swift and T-Pain all up on the same track
It's a thug story tell me now can you get with that

Taylor Swift:
What! What! I knit sweaters yo!

What! What! Don't test me (bleep)

Hey hold on, hold on I didn't even say anything

T-Pain:
What?

Taylor Swift:
I said "Yo"

Taylor Swift:
You guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
I didn't even swear

T-Pain:
She didn't even swear

Taylor Swift:
Hello
