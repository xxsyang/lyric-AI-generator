I know he loved you
A long time ago
I ain't jealous of you
Just thought you should know

You were never good enough for him
Or anything like me
So you might as well sit back
'Cause I ain't tryin' to show maturity

X is the shape I drew
Through your face
In permanent marker
Oh ya
Just like the mark you knew you were makin'
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
In permanent marker

I found those pictures
Of you in that green dress
Sure had a good time
Cleaning up that mess

He found 30 other pieces
But he'll never find them all
Tried to tape them back together
Now he knows to keep it off the wall

X is the shape I drew
Through your face
In permanent marker
Oh ya
Just like the mark you knew you were makin'
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
In permanent marker
X is the shape I drew

Through your face
In permanent marker
Oh ya
Just like the mark you knew you were makin'
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
In permanent marker

Well I don't appreciate you callin him to reminisce
The only reason is your seeing is how much better off he is

X is the shape I drew
Through your face
In permanent marker
Oh ya
Just like the mark you knew you were makin'
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
In permanent marker
X is the shape I drew
Through your face
In permanent marker
Oh ya
Just like the mark you knew you were makin'
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart

X is the shape I drew
Through your face
In permanent marker
Oh ya
Just like the mark you knew you were makin'
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
In permanent marker
X is the shape I drew
Through your face
In permanent marker
Oh ya
Just like the mark you knew you were makin'
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
In Permanent marker

In permanent Marker
