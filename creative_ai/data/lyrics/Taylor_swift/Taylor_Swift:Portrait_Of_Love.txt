I Luv you Cheri

Mama Mi amor I adore
Let Joc give you the world and more
Purchase the blue's it you's of course
Or we could vacate somewhere off shore
Or we could stay home tonight
Tops and pop we gonna get it right
Dim them lights be my snack in the middle of the night aight

See you at the corner
Corner of my eye
When you walking by
I get an appetite
Wanna take your picture
Wont you strike a pose
Turning them to up
Just wanna let you know

I think you're sexy
Baby wont you let me
Paint the prerfect picture of us
It's so electric (yeahhi)
Something classic
Make it everlasin'
It's gonna be incredible
Priceless
It can't be sold

Come and see the Portrait of Love (love, love, love)
This ain't the Mona Lisa
No Michaelangelo Picture
Come and see the Portrait of Love (love, love, love)
This ain't no history sculpture
Just a love getting closer (Yeah)

No need to be scared
It's not unusual to want somebody
More than physically
Oh no
U gotta play it fare
I promise that I'll be the only one
To blow your mind and get you there

I think you're sexy
Baby won't you let me
Paint the prerfect picture of us
It's so electric (yeahhi)
Something classic
Make it everlastin'
It's gonna be incredible

The creation of love
Beatiful and simply true (U U Uuu)
