This one goes out to all my fans!

I'd just like to say
How everyday
You guys make life rock
I depend on you
For your support
And what do ya know
You were always there
When I needed you
And in return I'd like to say

Thank you
For everything
I wouldn't be here without you
Thank you
I love you all

Each one another
I just wanna say
Thank you
Thank you today

I can't believe that you all
Helped me come this far
I think that's
The greatest thing ever
I couldn't ask for more
And I appreciate it

Thank you
For everything
I wouldn't be here without you
Thank you
I love you all

Oh yeah
Thank you
