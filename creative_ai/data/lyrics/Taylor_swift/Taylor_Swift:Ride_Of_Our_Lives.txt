It's 10am, I catch the morning train,
And there you are, you smile, with a seat you've saved,
Saying "hey, I've been waiting for ya".
We'd talk about our dreams, you'd talk 'bout everything,
We'd go so loud, but we don't care,

I'd pray, hoping that this moment lasts.

You've got me smiling, got me thinking that I've got it all.
You make a promise to me; promise this will be our tradition,
Cause every time we ride together it's like stranger than fiction.

But when it does baby, we can do it all over again.
And the train's coming to a stop,
I'm still so lost in you I can't bare to get off.
You kiss me on the spot.

See you tomorrow, yeah tomorrow we
