She walks to school with her arms crossed
It's just another day
At 10 o'clock she hears the screaming
Then finally she sees them

It's scary how things change
And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried

Didn't she call you
Didn't she need you bad enough?
Was there some reason
Another way up?

Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't she pray too?

He kissed his wife goodbye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep

Down the aisle
Three men walked and said
"We're here to die for our God"
He stood up and said, "That's funny
'Cause my God died for me"

I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried

Didn't he call you
Didn't he need you bad enough?
Was there some reason
Another way up?

Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't he pray too?

The taxis were full up
On the very day of
The rope 100 floors up
Just to come back down

They never thought they'd see the day
The, the tower'd be up in flames
There was nothing left to say
When it all came down

And didn't they call you
Didn't they need you bad enough?
Was there some reason
Another way up?

Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you?
Where were you?
And didn't they pray, oh

I walk to school and I wear a cross
I'm counting every day'''''
