Untouchable, like a distant diamond sky
Keep reaching out and I still can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you

Untouchable, burning hotter than the sun
And when you're close I just want to come undone

And in the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You've gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
Little taste of heaven

It's hurtful and I won't wait here all day
I know you think that I'll be here anyway

And in the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You've gotta come on, come on
I want to be together
Come on, come on
And in the middle of the night I wake up from this dream
I want to feel you in the dark lying next to me
You've gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on little taste of heaven.

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You've gotta come on, come on
Don't make me wait forever come on, come on
And in the middle of the night I wake up from this dream
I want to feel you in the dark lying next to me
You've gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on little taste of heaven.
Little taste of heaven, my little taste of heaven
