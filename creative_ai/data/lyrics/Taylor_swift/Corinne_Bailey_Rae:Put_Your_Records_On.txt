Three little birds, sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon
So sweet,
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Maybe sometimes, we got it wrong, but it's all right
The more things seems to change, the more they stay the same.
Oh, don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely,
Sipping tea in the bar by the road side,
(Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you,
Gotta love that afro hairdo

Maybe sometimes, we feel afraid, but it's all right
The more you stay the same, the more they seem to change
Don't you think it's strange?

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Just more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realise, that you don't even have to try any longer
Do what you want to

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
Just go ahead, let your hair down

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
Just go ahead, let your hair down

Oh, You're gonna find yourself somewhere, someho
