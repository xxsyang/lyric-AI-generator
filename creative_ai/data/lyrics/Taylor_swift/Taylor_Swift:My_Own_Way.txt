I don't want to break your heart
But you just keep on pushing me
I want to walk away
But you have ways of stopping me
I don't know what to say
Its just that I really want to leave
Cause your holding me back, holding me back from the life of luxury

So let me go my own way
Opposite from you
I don't care what you have to say
My hearts not in the mood
Though I really love you
You just keep hurting me
You say tell you what to do to make me happy
The only way is for you to let me leave

When ever we go out
I'm just a friend to you
But when we at home
You want to call me your boo
An I hate the fact
That when she comes around you make me go away
It's like you can't make up your mind
This is all I have to say

So let me go my own way
Opposite from you
I don't care what you have to say
My hearts not in the mood
Though I really love you
You just keep hurting me
You say tell you what to do to make me happy
The only way is for you to let me leave


You say I can count on you
But you just playing games
An I just let it slide
When call her name
You don't get it
I'm trying so hard not to walk away
But see now I'm tired of your two faces
So I'm just going to go my own way
So let me go my own way (My own way)
Opposite from you (From you, from you, from you)
I don't care what you have to say
My hearts not in the mood (Not in the mood)
Though I really love you
You just keep hurting me (You just keep hurting me)
You say tell you what to do to make me happy
The only way is for you to let me leave (Let me leave)

So let me go my own way
Opposite from you
I don't care what you have to say
My hearts not in the mood
Though I really love you
You just keep hurting me
You say tell you what to do to make me happy
The only way is for you to let me leave
Let me leave, an go my own way
Let me leave, an go my own way
Let me leave, an go my own way
Let me leave, an go my own
