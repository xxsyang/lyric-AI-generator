Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your eyes open

The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers, just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings

In backyards
Winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
Keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open

So here you are
Two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far

But turn around
Oh, they've surrounded you with a showdown
And nobody comes to save you now
But you got something they don't, yeah, you got something they don't
You just gotta keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes

Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night grows dark
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes ope
