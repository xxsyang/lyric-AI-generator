She said "I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shine
In the sky
The pretty lights
And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes
And said "Oh, my, my, my"

Took me back to the house and the backyard trees
Said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me
You never did
You never did
Took me back when the world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids
You and I
Oh, my, my, my

Well I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined
Like pretty lights
And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes,
And said "Oh, my, my, my"

Took me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. running in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Took me back to the time we had our very first fight
Slamming up doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside
Till the morning light
Oh, my, my, my

A few years have gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town,
And you looked at me
Got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came
And our mamas cried
You said "I do"
And I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on the very front porch
After all this time
You and I

I'll be eighty seven
You'll be eighty nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky
Oh, my, my, my''''''''
