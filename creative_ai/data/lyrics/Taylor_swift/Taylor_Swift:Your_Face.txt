I heard a song tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
She sees his face in every space, every room
And I know that if I turn around you won't be there
If I close my eyes, will you be there?

I don't wanna lose your face
And I don't wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
I don't wanna turn around
'Cause I'm not scared of what love gave me and took away
And I don't wanna lose your face...

I've got a picture of you in my bedroom
And I hope it never falls
I hope I never lose that feelin'
I used to get when you called
And then I wonder to myself
Who are you, where are you, where you ever here at all?

I don't wanna lose your face
And I don't wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
I don't wanna turn around
'Cause I'm not scared of what love gave me and took away
And I don't wanna lose your face...

That girl in the song had it so good
I wish I could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And I had you...

Oh, yeah
I don't wanna lose your face
And I don't wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't wanna turn around
'Cause I'm not scared of what love gave me and took away
And I don't wanna lose your face
Oh, no, no
I don't wanna lose your face
I don't wanna turn aro
