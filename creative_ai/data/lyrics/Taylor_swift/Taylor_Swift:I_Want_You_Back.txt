Oh baby give me one more chance
(I'll show you that I love you)
I want you please let me
Back in your heart

Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms

I want you back
I want you back
I want you back

I want you back, oh baby

I want you back
I want you back
I want you back

Oh whoa-oh

Oh baby give me one more chance
(I'll show you that I love you)
I want you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms'''
