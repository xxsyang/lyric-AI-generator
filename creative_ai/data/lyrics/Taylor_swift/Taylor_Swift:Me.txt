I am moving through the crowd
Trying to find myself
Feel like a guitar that's never played
Will someone strum away?

And I ask myself
Who do I wanna be?
Do I wanna throw away the key?
And invent a whole new me
And I tell myself
No One, No One
Don't wanna be
No One
But me...

You are moving through the crowd
Trying to find yourself
Feelin' like a doll left on a shelf
Will someone take you down?

And you ask yourself
Who do I wanna be?

Do I wanna throw away the key?
And invent a whole new me
Gotta tell yourself
No One, No One
Don't wanna be
No One
But me...

Your life plays out on the shadows of the wall
You turn the light on to erase it all
You wonder what it's like to not feel worthless
So open all the blinds and all the curtains

No One, No One
Don't wanna be
No One
But me...

We are moving through the crowd
