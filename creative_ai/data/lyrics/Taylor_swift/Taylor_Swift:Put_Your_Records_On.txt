Both:
Girl put your records on

Kellie:
Tell me your favorite song

Both:
You go ahead let your hair down

Kellie:
Sapphire and faded jeans

Both:
I hope you get your dreams

Kellie:
Go ahead leave your hair down

Kellie:
American girls
And American guys
Will always stand up and salute
Will always recognize
When they see old glory flyin
There's a lot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night
When we lay down our head

Taylor:
My daddy served in the army
When he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard
Till the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister, and me
To grow up and live free

Both:
Hey
Uncle Sam put your name
At the top of his list
And the statue of Liberty
Started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly
And it's gonna be hell
When you hear mother freedom
Start ringing her bell

And it'll feel like
The whole wide world
Is raining down on you
Oh brought to you courtesy
Of the red, white, and blue

Kellie:
Oh
Justice will be served
And the battle will rage

Both:
This big dog

Kellie:
Will fight
When you rattle his cage

Taylor:
You'll be sorry
That you messed with
The U.S. of

Both:
We'll put a red high heel
In your ass
It's the American way

Now Uncle Sam
Put your name
At the top of his list
And the statue of Liberty
Started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly
And it's gonna be hell
When you hear mother freedom
Start ringing her bell
And it'll feel like
The whole wide world
Is raining down on you
Oh ooh
Brought to you courtesy
Of the red, white, and b
