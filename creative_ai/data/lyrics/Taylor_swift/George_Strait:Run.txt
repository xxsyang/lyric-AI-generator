If there's a plane or a bus leavin' Dallas
I hope you're on it
If there's a train movin' fast down the tracks
I hope you caught it
'Cause I swear out there ain't where
You oughtta be
So, catch a ride, catch a cab
Don't you know I miss you bad?
But don't you walk to me

Baby, run
Cut a path across the blue skies
Straight in a straight line you can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So, baby, run

If you ain't got a suitcase
Get a box
Or an old brown paper sack
Pack it light or pack it heavy
Take a truck, take a Chevy
Baby, just come back
There's a shortcut to the highway outta town
Why don't you take it?
Don't let that speed limit slow ya down
Go on and break it

Baby, run
Cut a path across the blue skies
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby, run
Baby, run
Oh, baby, run
Baby, run'
