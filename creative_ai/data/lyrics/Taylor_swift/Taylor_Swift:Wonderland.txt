Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down the rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
I'm spinning out of control

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?

Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should've slept with one eye open that night

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it
Could last forever, eh

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse
But never better, eh

In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams

Oh, didn't they tell us, "Don't rush into things?"
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?

Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games till somebody loses their mind

Oh, darling, we found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it
Could last forever, eh

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse
But never better, eh

In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland, eh eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland

I reach for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home

You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in Wonderland
We both went mad

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it
Could last forever (last forever)

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse
But never better (never better)

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it
Could last forever

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse
But never better

In Wonderland'''''
