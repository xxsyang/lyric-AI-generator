We can step it up just a little bit of a notch. We can step it up I think. And I want you to sing along. To every song that I sing that you know please. As loud as you possibly can. I will not get offended. I think one of the cool things about being able to play guitar is that you can play whatever you want. And uh, you can play songs that you wrote or you can play songs that other people wrote or you can play country songs or you can play, you can play this.

To the left
To the left
Everything you own
In the box to the left
In the closet
That's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it
Please don't touch

Keep talking and yes that's fine
Could you walk and talk
At the same time and
It's my name that's on the tag
Come in with your bags
Let me call you a cab
Standin in the front yard
Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
How I'm never gonna find a man
Like you
Got me twisted

You must know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you
In a minute
Matter fact
He'll be here in a minute
Baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you
Ever for a second get to thinking

You're irreplaceable

So
Go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick
And see if she's home
Oops I bet you thought
That I didn't know
What'd ya think
I was putting you out for
'Cause you were untrue
Haulin her around in the truck
That I bought you
Baby drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standin in the front yard
Tellin' me
How I'm such a fool
Talkin' bout
How I'll never find a man like you
Got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact
He'll be here in a minute
Baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second
Get to thinking
You're irreplaceable
Y
