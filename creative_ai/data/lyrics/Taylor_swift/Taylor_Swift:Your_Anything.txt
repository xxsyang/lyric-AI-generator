I betchya lie awake at night
Tryin' to make up your sweet mind
Wonderin if you'll ever find
Just what you want
A home-town number one
Or a California loaded gun
But you know you only get one
Or that's what you thought
But here's what you've got

I could be your baby blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl livin' next door
I'll be your angel givin' up her wings
If that's whatchya need
I'd give everything to be your anything

If you want hard to get
If you want...
All you have to do is let me know
If you want a bumpy ride
Or someone with a softer side
Either one'll be all right
Just let me know
Cause this is where it goes

I could be your baby blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl livin' next door
I'll be your angel givin' up her wings
If that's whatchya need
I'd give everything to be your anything

It's not like I'm givin' up who I am for you
But for someone like you it's just so easy to do

I could be your baby blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl livin' next door
I'll be your angel givin' up her wings
If that's whatchya need...

If that's whatchya need

In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl livin' next door
I'll be your angel givin' up her wings
If that's whatchya n
