Standing on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
There's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
I'm heading out tonight, traveling light
I'm gonna start all over again

And buy a one way ticket on a west-bound train
See how far I can go (Because I can)
I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know (Because I can)
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting, down at the station
All I had to do was make up my mind

And buy a one way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go (Because I can)
I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know (Because I can)
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Well, I have walked through the fire
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out

I'm gonna buy a one way ticket on a west-bound train
See how far I can go (Because I can)
I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I'm gonna buy a one way ticket on a west bound train
Gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
I'm gonna sail the ocean, I'm gonna spread my wings
Gonna climb that mountain
Gonna do everythin
