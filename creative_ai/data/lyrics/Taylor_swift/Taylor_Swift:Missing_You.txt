Taylor (spoken):
Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Hilton
Um, I met him a couple months ago
Doing a show out in California
Um and I had met him because he had said some nice things about me in a magazine and said "Ya know I'm a really big fan of Taylor Swift's music" and I read that and I'm like wow that's really cool so I had my management contact his management and he arranged to come be at one of my shows.And so, ya know, I asked him to come out and sing with me.And while he was standing there next to me on stage I said "Tyler, how would you like to be in one of my music videos?" And uh, the crowd, he was kinda silent but the crowd was like "Yeah! Oh my God!" You guys know how to do that?

Crowd:
Woo!

Taylor (Spoken):
That's what I like to hear. Anyways, so he's standing here on stage and I'm like straight up "Do you wanna be in a music video? I'm shooting one in a couple weeks. And uh he goes "Well, I guess. Yeah sure." Because I mean the crowd was going so loud that if he would have said no they would have probably booed him off the stage. Which was kinda my point and asking him on stage. So basically I forced him to be in my music video.Have y'all seen that one? Would y'all like me to bring him out and do a song with him? Tyler Hilton's in the house tonight! So uh, the song I asked to sing with him um a couple months ago when we had a show together was one that he sings on One Tree Hill. Ya see, Tyler is on the show One Tree Hill because he's cool. He was also in the movie Walk The Line, he played Elvis Presley.So I decided to go all out for my hometown. So uh, Tyler ya gonna sing a song with me?

Tyler (spoken):
Yeah
Let's do it!
If ya guys know, sing along too.

Taylor:
Everytime I think of you
I always catch my breath
I'm still standing here
And your miles away
And I wonder why you left me
And there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart tonight

Tyler:
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spent my time just thinkin' about you
And its almost driving me wild

But it's my heart that's beggin down this long distance line tonight

Both:
And I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what I might say

Tyler:
There's a message in the wires
And I am sendin' you a signal tonight

You don't know how desperate I've become
And It looks like I'm loosein' this fight

But it's my heart that's breakin' down this long dusty road of mine

Both:
But I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missin' you at
No matter what my friends say

Taylor:
And there's a message that I'm sendin' out
Like a telograph to you or something
I can't bridge this distance
Honey, stop this heart ache all alone

Both:
I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say
I ain't missin' you
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missin' you
Yeah, no matter what your friends say

Hey yeah, yeah yeah yeah

I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missin' you
No

Taylor (Spoken):
Good Night everybody!
Woo!
Woo
