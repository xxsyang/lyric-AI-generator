I'll be there in the back of your mind
'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met 'til you making me cry 
And it's just too bad you've already had
The best days, the best days of your life

Ain't it a shame?
A shame that every time you hear my name
Brought up in a casual conversation
You can't think straight

And ain't it sad?
You can't forget about what we had
Take a look at her and do you like what you see

And it's just too bad you've already had
The best days, the best days of your life

Have a nice little family
Live out my dreams with someone new
But I've been told that a cheater
Is always a cheater
So I've got my pride and she's got you

'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met 'til you were making me cry
And it's just too bad you've already had
The best days, the best days of your life
Of your life
Oh oh yeah

It's a shame
It's a sh
