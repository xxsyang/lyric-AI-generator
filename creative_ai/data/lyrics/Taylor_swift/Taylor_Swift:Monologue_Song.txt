I like glitter and sparkly dresses
But I'm not gonna talk about that

But I'm not gonna talk about that
In my monologue

La la la,
La la la

I like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me
But I'm not gonna say that

I like writing their names into songs
So that they're ashamed to go in public
But I'm not gonna say that
In my monologue

La la,
La la la la la
This is my musical monologue!

But I'm not gonna brag about that
In my monologue

La la la, ha ha ha
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha, la la la

It's my SNL monologue
La la,
La la la la la
This is my SNL monologue

La la,
La la la la la
That was my SNL monolo
