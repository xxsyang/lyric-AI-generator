You say you want to wait to get married,
Why you in a pause,
You say it's not your time yet,
When is the perfect time for you

Just let me go, tell me I'm not the one for you
Tell me you found someone else in your life
Tell me I wasn't good enough for you
But don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore

What changed your mind in two days
Did I do something wrong to make you put a hold
On our future,
It was just a week ago when you asked me
What date I plan to ask you the big question,
Why did you do this to me

Just let me go, tell me I'm not the one for you
Tell me you found someone else in your life
Tell me I wasn't good enough for you
But don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore

It was perfectly set how it would go down
All our dream would have come real
Now you put them in a coffin and put the dirt on them
Should just add a stone to them and make it read
Here lies the dreams of a fallen futures,

Just let me go, tell me I'm not the one for you

Tell me you found someone else in your life
Tell me I wasn't good enough for you
But don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore

Why did yo do this
Now I stand here with this ring, flowers, and dirt on my knees
Tears falling down my eyes with humiliation,
It might as well just rain and have lightning strike and miss me,
Tonight isn't a lucky night,

Now I can't look you in the eyes any more,
Just go ahead and walk away
Just leave me here in my misery of shame,

Just let me go, tell me I'm not the one for you
Tell me you found someone else in your life
Tell me I wasn't good enough for you
Don't say you're sorry
And don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore

You say you want to wait to get married
You say you're not ready yet
You say today isn't good enough for you
Do me a favor and do put me on hold,
Because I don't want to anymore'''''''''''''
