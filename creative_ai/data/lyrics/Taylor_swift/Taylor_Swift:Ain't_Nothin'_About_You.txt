The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing about you
That don't do something for me

The way you kiss, the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing about you
That don't do something for me

Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing about you
That don't do something for me

The way you kiss, the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing about you
That don't do something for me

Oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby, it's no mystery why I surrender
Boy, you got everything

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing about you
That don't do something for me

The way you kiss, the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing about you
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, all your tattoos
Your every thought, your smile, your lips
And boy, the list goes on and on, and on

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There's ain't nothing about you
That don't do something for me

The way you kiss, the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing 'bout you
That don't do something for me

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
Your dance, your drive
You make me feel alive

Right now I think you see
There ain't nothing about you
That don't do something for me'''''''''''''
