You were the guy I always dreamed of.
You were the guy that I loved.
But then you had to leave me.
I asked when you would call me.
You replied meet me at the wildernes at nine.
I went there standin waitin to see your face...
You never showed up I was there for hours, I was waitin to see your face.
I'll stand here for hours under this lonely spot light.
I'll wait all night till I see your face.
Oh waitin to see your face.
I went to the mall with all my friends to see if you were there
I saw you with another girl
I didn't think to swear.
I went home crying to see if you were there
If a message was left I would cry my tears.
I was watin to see your face.
I'll stand here for hours under this lonely spot light.
I'll wait all night till I see your face.
Oh waitin to see your face.
Then I had your call for me and I saw your face lookin' at me
I was glad to see!
We went we cried to the the wilderness---I'm not alone...
Under the spot light any more...
Any more--- any more--- ANY MO
