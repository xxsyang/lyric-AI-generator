If you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough

I'd like to keep you till I'm old
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, Perfect Have I Loved

Do you remember the stupid things we used to do?
Before September stole me away from you
The time we got your truck stuck in the creek
'Cause baby, roads weren't wild enough for you and me

Sayin'

If you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you till I'm old
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, Perfect Have I Loved

I used to see you by the bridge we used to cross
I found the feeling of trying to get lost
You would smile that smile that I tried so hard to forget

It's hard to douse a fire that I still haven't put out yet

And if you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you till I'm old
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, Perfect Have I Loved

Love was all we knew
And faith was growing on the vines
Words were all we had
And for one Summer you were mine

Sayin'

If you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe, this will be enough
I'd like to keep you till I'm old
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, Perfect Have I Lo
