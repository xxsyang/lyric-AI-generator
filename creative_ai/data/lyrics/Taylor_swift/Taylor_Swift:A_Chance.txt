One, two, three, four,
Before I know it, I'm out the door
Five, six, seven, eight,
Oh, why, didn't I, wait?
Nine and ten,
I sure do regret, then

Oh wait!
For another chance
You need,
To take a risk
So hey,
Just wait! Before it is too late,
Just take, a chance
So tell, me why,
It takes me time,
To wonder how,
How I got this far
But why, didn't I wait?
There was a chance, I needed to take!

Oh wait!
For another chance,
You need,
To take a little risk
So hey!
Just wait!
Before it's too late
Just take, a chance
:
So imagine, what it would be like,
If we never took risks,
Or we never had a chance
To
Live
La la la la, la la la la la la, la la la la, la la la la oh oh

Oh wait!
For another chance
You need,
To take a risk
So hey,
Just wait!
Before it is too late,
Just take, a chance
Oh
