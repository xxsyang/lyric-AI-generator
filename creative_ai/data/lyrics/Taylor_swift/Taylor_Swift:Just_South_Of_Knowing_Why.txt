She didn't have a reason to go, oh no
She didn't have a reason to stay
Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun,
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run

And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound,
But I understand it somehow

If I could drive all night
Would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
An unfamiliar exit sign
If I just drive on by,
Just south of knowing why

I didn't really know her that well,
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind.
She felt so out of touch, just felt too much
If you don't know what you want, nothings ever enough

And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound,
That's where I'm headed right now

If I could drive all night
Would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
An unfamiliar exit sign
If I just drive on by,
Just south of knowing why

I don't have a plan
I don't have a map
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
I don't have a when
And I don't have a where
I don't even know if I'm knowing I'm there

And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound,
But I understand it somehow

But If I could drive all night
Would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
An unfamiliar exit sign
If I just drive on by,
Just south of knowing why

I just drive on by
Drive on
Drive on
Drive all night

If I drive on
Drive on
Drive on
Drive all night
Just south of knowing
