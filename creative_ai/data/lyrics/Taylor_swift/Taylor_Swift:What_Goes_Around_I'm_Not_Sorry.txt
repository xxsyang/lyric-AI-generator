It's this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find...

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, goes around
Oh no no no
Oh no no no
Oh no no no

You're not sorry, oh no no no

And every time you call him
You spend your nights alone
And he never comes home
And every time you call him
All you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out
That he's doing to you
What you did to me
Girl you got what you deserved'''''
