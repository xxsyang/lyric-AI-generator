I drive around this town in a mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well that's good enough for me
I don't need the real thing
That's just another thing for me to try to tame
I don't know if I could' it might just break me
I thought there for a little while every sunset
I'd be riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough' running free
That's the closest to a cowboy you'll see me

Before I met him I was so safe and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie and crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads and I got my heart broken
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go
I thought there for a little while every sunset
I'd be riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough' running free
That's the closest to a cowboy you'll see me

It was all a bit wonderful and strange
But I'll never look at a sunset the same
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough' running free
Sitting fishing by the riverbank
Swimming in the water tank
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough' running free
That's the closest you'll see
